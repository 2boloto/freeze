Overview
==

This Slice API reference was generated from the Slice files in the
[zeroc-ice/freeze GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/freeze/tree/3.7/slice)
using ZeroC's [fork of Doxygen](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/doxygen) that includes
Slice support. We provide a [tag file](../freeze.tag) if you would like to include
links to this documentation in your own Doxygen projects.

The [language mapping chapters](https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice37/Language+Mappings)
in the Ice Manual describe how Slice APIs map to programming language APIs.

Refer to the [Freeze Manual](https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Freeze37/Freeze+Manual) for
more information on using Freeze.
