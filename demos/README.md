# Freeze Demos

The demos directory provides sample programs for Freeze.

## Layout

The sample programs are grouped by programming language:
* [C++98](./cpp98)
* [Java-Compat](./java-compat)

For example, the [cpp98](./cpp98) folder contains all the sample programs
written in C++ that demonstrate the use of Freeze with the Ice C++98 mapping.

## Building and Running the Sample Programs

The README.md file in each language subdirectory provides instructions for
building and running the sample programs.

## License

The sample programs are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2
([GPLv2](../LICENSE)).
